This repo contains the .stl files to 3D print the mother machine centrifuge adapters. 

To balance your centrifuge, you need 2 of the Universal_Adapters.stl, and 4 of the Universal_Holders.stl (all 4 come in the same file).
The units in the file are milimiters.
These are intended to be used for 60mm wide coverslips of the bed where the coverslip goes.

Alternatively, You can print the one named Eppendorf5424_2_chip_holder.stl that is meant to replace the rotor of your centrifuge. You can secure it with the same nut you would the rotor.

Printed in Ultimaker's Tough-PLA. nothing snapped below 2500g typical centrifugation speeds for our applications are < 1000g
